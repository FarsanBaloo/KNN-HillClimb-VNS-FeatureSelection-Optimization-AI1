The hill climbing algorithm with random restarts typically works as follows:

The algorithm starts with an initial solution.
It evaluates the fitness of the initial solution.
The algorithm generates a set of neighboring solutions (typically by slightly modifying the current solution).
It evaluates the fitness of each neighboring solution.
The algorithm selects the best neighboring solution (i.e., the one with the highest fitness) and sets it as the current solution.
If the current solution is the global maximum, the algorithm terminates. Otherwise, it repeats steps 3-5 until either
the global maximum is found or a termination condition is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations is reached).

When the algorithm reaches a local maximum, it performs a random restart by generating a completely new random solution
and starting again from step 2. This increases the likelihood of finding the global maximum by exploring a different area of the solution space.


Sow during each iteration of the algorithm, the hill climbing with random restarts approach
checks all the neighboring solutions and selects the best one as the current solution. However,
if the algorithm gets stuck at a local maximum, it generates a completely new random solution to explore
a different part of the solution space and improve the chances of finding the global maximum.
